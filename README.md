# kill_shopify_popup

Hides the "Someone bought..." popup on Shopify sites.

Long story short, I hate the popup on Shopify sites down in the lower left corner where it says, "Someone bought..." and then shows a product. I don't care what other people are buying. I'm there for what I want, not for what they want. It's a distraction, and, about half the time, it comes up over content I'm trying to read. It's intrusive. Even a little insulting. It makes me want to find a non-shopify retailer to buy from. That popup annoys me to a depth that no neurotypical person will ever understand.

This script adds a rule to the css of the page that hides the popup. That's it. 

.stocksheep_popup_desktop_bottom_left { display:none; }

ta-da.
